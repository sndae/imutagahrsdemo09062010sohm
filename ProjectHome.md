The project provides the source code for the AHRS demo software for the IMU tag v1.0.  The software interprets sensor data received via Bluetooth and processes the data through a sensor fusion algorithm to provide an estimate of the IMU tagâ€™s orientation in the world frame.  This data is then used to orientate the on-screen cuboid in real-time.  This project requires Microsoft xna.

Available for download (tab above) is the complete Visual Studio 2008 project folder (zip).
